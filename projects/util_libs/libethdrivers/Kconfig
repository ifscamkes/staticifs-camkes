        The number of RX descriptors in the descriptor ring for the
        driver.

        The number of TX descriptors in the descriptor ring for the
        driver.

        To avoid allocating and freeing buffers continuously the driver
        can preallocate a base amount internally.

    int "Size of preallocated DMA buffers"

    default 2048
    help
        The size of each preallocated buffer that will be used for RX and
        TX allocation requests. This needs to be the maximum of the RX buffer
        size and the MTU. Currently the largest RX buffer of any of the
        implemented drivers is 2048, and the MTU is 1500

        Use an async instead of a polling driver for PicoTCP.
